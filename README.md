## Pongbot 0.9

#Quickstart guide:

1) Make sure you're registered with pongbot.

```
Run "pongbot register".
```

2) Challenge someone, or a team.

If singles:


```
pongbot challenge singles <opponent's name>
```

If doubles:

```
pongbot challenge double <teammate's name> against <opponent_1> <opponent_2>
```

3) Let them run this, to accept the challenge. Only one other person (teammate or opponent) needs to accept to confirm the challenge.

```
pongbot accept
```

4) Game on!

5) Record the match. Only the person/team that lost can record, it'll automatically change everyone's scores/rankings.


```
pongbot lost
```
